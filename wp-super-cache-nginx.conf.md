       }
```

If your server block serves only http requests you should change this line:

```
    set $cachefile "/wp-content/cache/supercache/$host$cache_uri/index-https.html"
```

to this:

```
    set $cachefile "/wp-content/cache/supercache/$host$cache_uri/index.html";
```

If your server block serves http and https requests you should change it like this:

```
    set $cachefile "/wp-content/cache/supercache/$host$cache_uri/index.html";
    if ($scheme = https) {
        set $cachefile "/wp-content/cache/supercache/$host$cache_uri/index-https.html";
    }
```

In some guides you may find such example:
```
    # not very good example, however it works
    set $cachefile "/wp-content/cache/supercache/$host/$cache_uri/index.html";
    if ($https ~* "on") {
        set $cachefile "/wp-content/cache/supercache/$host/$cache_uri/index-https.html";
    }
```

However, the symbol `/` before `$cache_uri` is redundant - the `$cache_uri` variable contains leading `/`.

Also, the `$https ~* "on"` is not as efficient as `$scheme = https`.

If possible, avoid using `if`s.


If you want to make an exception only for logged in users, change this:

```
        # Don't use the cache for logged-in users or recent commenters
        if ($http_cookie ~* "comment_author|wordpress_[a-f0-9]+
                             |wp-postpass|wordpress_logged_in") {
            set $cache_uri 'null cache';
        }
```

to this:

```
        # Don't use the cache for logged-in users
        if ($http_cookie ~* "wordpress_logged_in") {
            set $cache_uri 'null cache';
        }
```

According to my observation, recent commenters will view their own comments immediately after they post them (the cache is rebuilding on the fly), so you may configure the server to serve cached content to them.

There is also an option on WP Super Cache called "Make known users anonymous so theyâ€™re served supercached static files". This way logged in users will receive cached pages, but not directly by Nginx (cache will be server after invoking WordPress).

## WP_CRON

Because the WordPress will not be invoked often (because of Nginx serving cache most of the time), I suggest to disable WP-CRON by adding `define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);` to the `wp-config.php` and to create a cron job to be executed every minute with the correct username: `cd /home/UserAccountChangeMe/public_html/ ; php -q wp-cron.php`.

## CloudFlare and Incapsula

Cloudflare/Incapsula may block some or all requests made by WordPress. This may interfere with the *preload*, because *preload* is working by *WP Super Cache* sending requests to the web server using WP's [http API](https://codex.wordpress.org/HTTP_API). These requests are with user agent `WordPress/4.7.2; https://example.com`.

Even if there are no blocked requests, it is inefficient to send request to CloudFlare/Incapsula server, the latter to send request to the Nginx, Nginx to invoke WordPress, etc.

The solution is to add your domain name to `/etc/hosts` with your local IP address. For example:

```
93.184.216.34 example.com www.example.com
```

You should remember to change this if you change the IP address where Nginx is listening.

# Using self-signed TLS certificate (a.k.a. SSL certificate)

If you use self-signed TLS certificate preload will not work. In order to make it work you should use a valid TLScertificate or add your TLS certificate to the WordPress's `ca-bundle.crt`:

```
# su myusername
$ cd ~/public_html/wp-includes/certificates
$ cp ca-bundle.crt  ca-bundle.crt.bak
$ cat ~/ssl.cert >> ca-bundle.crt
```

This file will be overwritten when you update your WordPress, so this is not a good permanent solution.

## favicon.ico and robots.txt

If you don't have `/favicon.ico` the WordPress will be invoked every time when someone is visiting your webiste just to say "there is no such file", which is not efficient. Instead, create such file or use configuration like this:

```
location = /favicon.ico { return 404; log_not_found off; access_log off; } # remove this line if you have favicon.ico
```

If you don't have `robots.txt` file the problem is similar â€“ every time when a robot (i.e. Google bot) is visiting your website, WordPress will be invoked just to say "error 404". The simplest and fastest solution is just to create empty `robots.txt` file.

## Serving static .gz files, compressed in advance by WP Super Cache

You may add `gzip_static on;` in the `location` block, but this feature will work only if it is enabled during compilation with `--with-http_gzip_static_module`.

Find this code:

```
        # Try in the following order: (1) cachefile, (2) normal url, (3) php
        location / {
            try_files $cachefile $uri $uri/ /index.php;
        }
```

And change it like this:

```
        # Try in the following order: (1) cachefile, (2) normal url, (3) php
        location / {
            gzip_static on; # Enable Nginx's gzip static module
            try_files $cachefile $uri $uri/ /index.php;
        }
```

To verify that this feature is enabled during compilation:

```
$ nginx -V
nginx version: nginx/1.10.2
built by gcc 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4) (GCC)

```

In the example above it is enabled.

To enable creation of `.gz` files by WP Super Cache, go to Settings -> WP Super Cache -> Advanced and check this checkbox:

```
[x] Compress pages so theyâ€™re served more quickly to visitors. (Recommended)
```

You may use this shell script to compress all `.css`, `.js`, `.ttp`, `.eot`, `.woff` and `.ttf` files found *in current directory* and its subdirectories:

```
#!/bin/bash
# compress_with_gzip_recursively.bash

exit; # remove this line after you are sure what you are doing

find -name '*.css' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.ttp' -o -name '*.eot' -o -name '*.woff' -o -name '*.ttf'  | while read LN; do

gzip --best --verbose --verbose -c -- "$LN" > "$LN.gz"

done
```

This will work also with old gzip versions, which don't support the `--keep` option (to keep the original file after compressing).

You need to run this script again after update.

```
$ cd ~/public_html/
$ ~/bin/compress_with_gzip_recursively.bash
```

Here is what happened when I started this script on my WordPress test install:
